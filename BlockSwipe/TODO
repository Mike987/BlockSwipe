Stuff to do:

1. fuck shit up
2. Generate from start up, fill up a level buffer for about 5 levels in case of slow generation.
3. Generally get generating in a better place, try making it faster if possible during levels
4. keep generated buffer in sharedprefs
5. Fix the way activities are being started and stopped.

Future:

1. Bot must be able to solve levels with Keys - then generate Key levels
2. solve button levels - generate button levels
3. Multi cell? or possibly just small blocks for super complex huge levels
4. Tilt controlled block - bot solve + gen
5. Portals? Maybe just a way to move between multiCell levels? or within levels.  Either or both.
6. Online Head to head time trial.
